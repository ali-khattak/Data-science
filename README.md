This code performs an analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on its impact on public health and the economy.
It first loads and preprocesses the dataset, handling missing values and converting date columns to datetime format. 
Then, it visualizes the data through histograms, time series plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables. 
Additionally, it calculates daily new cases and rolling averages, and conducts hypothesis testing to examine the economic impact of the pandemic. 
Finally, it applies linear regression to predict COVID-19 cases based on economic indicators and evaluates the model's performance. 
The key findings highlight correlations between economic indicators and COVID-19 cases, time series patterns, and the pandemic's economic impact, providing insights for decision-makers.
