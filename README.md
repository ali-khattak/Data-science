### COVID-19 Data Analysis and Stock Market Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing COVID-19 data and predicting stock market trends. The COVID-19 analysis focuses on exploring the pandemic's impact on public health and the economy. It includes preprocessing the dataset, visualizing data through various plots, calculating daily new cases and rolling averages, and conducting hypothesis testing. Additionally, linear regression is applied to predict COVID-19 cases based on economic indicators.



The stock market prediction part of the project involves gathering live data from different stock markets of several countries. The data includes information on the top 30% of stock market companies from each country. The Python scripts preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and use linear regression to predict stock market trends based on historical data.




Together, these analyses provide valuable insights into the relationship between economic indicators and COVID-19 cases, as well as trends in the global stock market. The project aims to assist decision-makers in understanding and navigating the complexities of public health and economic challenges during the pandemic.
